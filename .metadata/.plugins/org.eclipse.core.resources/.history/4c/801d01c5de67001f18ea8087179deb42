## I2C vs I3C - CGP 1/9/24

I wasted a load of time trying to get the I2C communications working with the WW130_cli application.
The hardware was OK as the identical hardware and WW130 software worked with ww130_test, and I was apparently running
the same software in ww130_cli. But the WW130 gave errors showing that the Seeed board was not responding by asserting the ACK.

It took a long time to find but the answer is in the drivers that are selected by makefiles.
The ww130_cli project, which was (probably) derived by copying hello_world_freertos_tz_s_only, includes this in drv_user_defined.mk:

```
DRIVERS_IP_INSTANCE  ?= RTC0 \
						<snip>
						IIIC_SLAVE0 \
						IIIC_SLAVE1 \
```
Whereas ww130_test, derived from allon_sensor_tflm_freertos, has this in drv_onecore_cm55m_s.mk:
```
DRIVERS_IP_INSTANCE  ?= RTC0 \
						<snip>
						IIC_SLAVE0 \
						IIC_SLAVE1 \
```

Both versions will compile but only the IIC version will run.

Apparently I2C and I3C are both available in the HX6538. I3C is capable of higher speed operation, but this is not supported by
the nRF52832 (which is the I2C master) so there is no point in trying to get I3C working.
