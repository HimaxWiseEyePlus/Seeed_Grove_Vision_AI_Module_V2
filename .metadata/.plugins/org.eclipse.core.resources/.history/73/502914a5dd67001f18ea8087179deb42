## I2C vs I3C - CGP 1/9/24

I wasted a load of time trying to get the I2C communications working with the WW130_cli application.
The hardware was OK as the identical hardware and WW130 software worked with ww130_test, and I was apparently running
the same software in ww130_cli. But the WW130 gave errors showing that the Seeed board was not responding by asserting the ACK.

It took a long time to find but the answer is in the drivers that are selected by makefiles.
The ww130_cli project, which was (probably) derived by copying hello_world_freertos_tz_s_only, includes this in drv_user_defined.mk:

```
DRIVERS_IP_INSTANCE  ?= RTC0 \
						<snip>
						IIIC_SLAVE0 \
						IIIC_SLAVE1 \
```
Whereas ww130_test, derived from allon_sensor_tflm_freertos, has this in drv_onecore_cm55m_s.mk:
```
DRIVERS_IP_INSTANCE  ?= RTC0 \
						<snip>
						IIC_SLAVE0 \
						IIC_SLAVE1 \
```
