## WW130 firmware for this application

The 'i2c_slave_app' project works with the project 'twi_master_seeed' on the WW130.

This folder includes essential/important files from the WW130 project:

- twi_master_seeed_ww130_b00_000402.zip. This file can be installed on the WW130 using the DFU mechanism.
- readme.txt which is my own notes on how I built 'twi_master_seeed' 
- operation.txt which are notes on how to operate the two boards together.
