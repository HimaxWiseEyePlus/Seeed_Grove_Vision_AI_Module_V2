## WW130 firmware for this application

The 'ww130_test' project works with the project 'Rewild_1' on the WW130. Often, developments with the Seeed board
require changes on the WW130 as well.

This folder includes essential/important files from the WW130 project:

- Rewild_1_ww130_b00_000502.zip. 

This file can be installed on the WW130 using the DFU mechanism which is documented in the WW130_DFU.md file.
