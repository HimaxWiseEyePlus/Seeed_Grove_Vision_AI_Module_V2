WW500 Configuration Files - CGP 22 November 2025
================================================

The CONFIG folder is a folder to place onto the SD card containing configuration files.

Its name might change in the future.

As of the time of wriring, the key configuration file(s) are:

* CONFIG.TXT = contains the Operational Parameters which define things like time lapse interval.
* HM0360EX.BIN = Extra register settings for the HM0360 sensor (optional).

* config_file.md is not used by the WW500. It provides documentation for the user.

At the time of writing the firmware looks for the above 2 files in the CONFIG folder.

This will change.
