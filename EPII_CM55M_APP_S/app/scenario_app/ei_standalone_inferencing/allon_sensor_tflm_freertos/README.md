# allon_sensor_tflm_freertos
This is the scenario_app which can capture 10 images and then sleep for 1 second before getting up and take another picture, then sleep for 1 second before getting up and take another picture, and continue.  
You can also change the setting for how many images you need to capture at [here](https://github.com/HimaxWiseEyePlus/Seeed_Grove_Vision_AI_Module_V2/blob/main/EPII_CM55M_APP_S/app/scenario_app/allon_sensor_tflm_freertos/common_config.h#L24).
```
#define SUPPORT_FATFS               0       // 0 : send images via SPI, 1 : save images to SD card
#define ENTER_SLEEP_MODE			0		// 0 : always on, 1 : enter Sleep mode
#define SENSOR_AE_STABLE_CNT		10
#define ENTER_PMU_MODE_FRAME_CNT	3
```
- SUPPORT_FATFS : (0) send images via SPI, (1) save images to SD card
- ENTER_SLEEP_MODE : (0) always on, (1) enter Sleep mode
- SENSOR_AE_STABLE_CNT : how many images to capture and then enter sleep mode
- ENTER_PMU_MODE_FRAME_CNT : After waking up, capture how many images and then enter sleep mode.
